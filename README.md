# XORNeuralNetwork
Basic example of 2 layer neural network based on the code in https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/
and adapted for the XOR function in Python 3.

I suggest to have a look to the sigmoid function and its derivate (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function)

Requirements:
- Python 3
- Numpy library
